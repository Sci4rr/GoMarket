This Go server is designed as a robust backend for a marketplace platform, efficiently handling API requests across three core domains: product listings, user authentication, and transaction processing. Built on Go's powerful HTTP capabilities, the server is optimized for high concurrency and fast response times, ensuring a smooth operation even under heavy user traffic. The implementation provides a scalable and secure way to manage marketplace activities, including browsing products, user sign-in and sign-up processes, and secure transaction handling. This repository includes all necessary code, documentation, and guidelines for setting up and deploying the server, making it a comprehensive resource for developers looking to establish or enhance a marketplace infrastructure.
